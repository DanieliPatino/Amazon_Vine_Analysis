## 3.	Summary: 
Just looking at the Electronics dataset, it does not look like a lot of Vine members are writing reviews, and less are giving the products five stars. 
Based of the almost 4,000 number difference between the paid and unpaid Vine favoring the unpaid reviews, I would say there is not a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. 

Looking at the percentage of the 5 stars from the Vine reviews, it is only 42%

An additional analysis I would do would be to check how many purchases the average Vine members buys. This would help us determine if enough Vine members are buying enough product to determine how many of those purchases are getting a review.
